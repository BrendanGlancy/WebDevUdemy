Were starting with an index.html file 

he creates 2 folder which i already have created 

He names the file HelloWorld.html

He launches his html page through the finder, I will try to launch it 
through the command line, have to make an edit of my bash_profile 

alias chrome="open -a \"Google Chrome\"

HTML = hyper text markup language
example.com

we want to look at the html that makes this page

document has starting and closing <html> tags
has some head tags
body tags 
divs and h1 tags

has a little bit of css but i dont think were going to be looking at that
yet

<a href> link tag

the h1 tag is a header so it makes it large and bold

p is a paragraph tag

title tags appear on browswer tags charset is utf-8

three meta tags one says utf-8 
one sets the width

style type = text/css

the css makes the backgroud grey 
has margin and padding 

@media tag for the mobile users 

tags that divide up sections of our code so we can have our web document page

were going to start with some html tags, 

Now were onto header tags oh me oh my

there are 6 h tags

now <p>

br is a line break and has no closing tag
<b> makes things bold

<em> is italic
<ins> underline
<sup> is superscript
<del> deleted has a line through the text
<hr> is a line going across the page

list in html:
ul is unordered list
ol is ordered list

if you don't know whose in my image are you really a real coder??

Forms in html

<form>

Forms are easy to use and can transfer data between hyper text pages
The are all kinds of things like type value and placeholder attributes

Tables in html:
going to make a new html file at this point

In vim to remove any line you may have copied over by accident use the 
regex string:
:%s *\d*  //
