Cascading Style Sheets

At the end of the section we will make a clone of the bbc

Will take more notes if I see fit


There a 3 ways to add css to a webpage, the first I am learning about
in this course is inline css

Inline css is like it sounds, it goes in the line with the html
usually starts in this format, <tag style="what you want in quotes">


Something weird, say you have an h1 tag that is half the size,
if you said style="font-size:50%" it would make the h1 tag
    1/4 the size it normally is

That is because when you say font-size: percent, the percent is relative
to a <p> tag

^ I am thinking this may be on the css exam at the end of the unit

There are some problems with inline css:
     it's hard to read
     all the inline stuff is specific to a p tag

     Only should be used for very specific stuff

Internal CSS, put a style tag in the head, can be anywhere but this is 
standard practice

 Inline CSS has the highest priority, then comes Internal/Embedded followed by External CSS which has the least priority

/* this is how you comment in internal css */

putting a dot in front of your css is a class selector

NTS: if I am going to make a new page for every lesson I need to end it 
with .html
or it will just display as a page and the hyper text will not be marked up

When working with IDs you use a # in front of the id name

for example:
    #green {
        color: green;
        }

classes and ID have different uses, you should only use an ID once
While classes can be called more than once

Instead of using strong or em tags, you can use a span tag and style it with
css

DIVS:

Its easy to put divs around sections of html and then style them 

You can give a div an ID or a class, or you can apply the style to the
div itself

You can use hex code to style you websites, and get much better colors 
thats where vim can be not as good as some other text editiors

COLORS:

It seems like rob is going to talk about html color codes

HTML color codes.info seems like a good place to get the exact color you 
want for web dev stuff quickly

God front end stuff is fun

FLOATING:

Position with css using floats

Float: left | right | center move div sections accordingly

Positioning 
postion:relative 
z-index is the precident of which element is displayed in the front

opacity is how see through an element is 
0 is invisible 1 is completly solid, so you have to be in between those
number in general when you're developing

position absolute means that the element is positioned absolute to its
parent element

the element is positioned related to the browser window
the element will move as you scroll on the page

You would probably use a fixed position for a menu at the top of your page




MARGIN:
Starts at the top goes around the box clockwise

you can use margin-bottom margin-left margin-right or margin-top

PADDING:
