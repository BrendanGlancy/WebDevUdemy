Cascading Style Sheets

At the end of the section we will make a clone of the bbc

Will take more notes if I see fit


There a 3 ways to add css to a webpage, the first I am learning about
in this course is inline css

Inline css is like it sounds, it goes in the line with the html
usually starts in this format, <tag style="what you want in quotes">


Something weird, say you have an h1 tag that is half the size,
if you said style="font-size:50%" it would make the h1 tag
    1/4 the size it normally is

That is because when you say font-size: percent, the percent is relative
to a <p> tag

^ I am thinking this may be on the css exam at the end of the unit

There are some problems with inline css:
     it's hard to read
     all the inline stuff is specific to a p tag

     Only should be used for very specific stuff

Internal CSS, put a style tag in the head, can be anywhere but this is 
standard practice

 Inline CSS has the highest priority, then comes Internal/Embedded followed by External CSS which has the least priority

/* this is how you comment in internal css */
